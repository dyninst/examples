# Example usage of [Dyninst](https://github.com/dyninst/dyninst)

## Building

Before building any of these examples, you need an existing build of Dyninst (see the Dyninst [wiki](https://github.com/dyninst/dyninst/wiki/Building-Dyninst) for details).

To configure the build, you can use

    cmake . -DDyninst_DIR=path/to/Dyninst/install/lib/cmake/Dyninst

NOTE: The last three parts of the `Dyninst_DIR` path *must* be the `lib/cmake/Dyninst` directory under your Dyninst installation.

The project can be built out-of-source using the usual `-B` and `-H` CMake flags.

The default CMake configure uses GNU Makefiles as the generator, so to build is just

    make install

## Running

Each example is built in its own subdirectory under the main build directory (if you didn't specify `-B` when running CMake, the build directory is just the root of the `examples` project directory). For example, to run the codeCoverage example

	$ cd codeCoverage
	$ export DYNINSTAPI_RT_LIB=path/to/dyninst/lib/libdyninstAPI_RT.so
	$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.:path/to/dyninst/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	$ ./code_coverage -p testcc testcc.inst
	$ ./testcc.inst
