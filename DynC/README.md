# DynC

## The Dyninst C-like snippet language

Dyninst is a powerful instrumentation tool, but specifying
instrumentation code (known as an Abstract Syntax Tree) in the
BPatch snippet language can be cumbersome. DynC API enables a programmer to easily and quickly build
snippets using a simple C-like language. Other advantages to
specifying snippets using DynC include cleaner, more readable
mutator code, automatic variable handling, and runtime-compiled
snippets.
